    "In this project we’ve implemented a strategy presented by [Skolik et al., 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.14904) (check the [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/quantum/blob/research/layerwise_learning/layerwise_learning.ipynb) in Tensorflow Quantum) for effectively quantum neural networks. In layerwise learning the strategy is to gradually increase the number of parameters by adding a few layers and training them while freezing the parameters of previous layers already trained.\n",
    "An easy way for understanding this technique is to think that we’re dividing the problem into smaller circuits to successfully avoid to fall into [Barren Plateaus](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.11173). Here, we provide a proof-of-concept for the implementation of this technique in Pennylane’s Pytorch interface.\n",
